# BidtoWin
An Online Auction Platform

Bidtowin is a online auction platform where users can either bid on the existing items or the users can sell their own items through our platform. 

During this COVID-19 pandemic, we know that it became difficult to conduct offline auctions. So to overcome this situation we have developed this online auction platform to conduct auctions simply by sitting at home.

The items that are there on the website are generally unique or rare. 

This is an enormous platform for trade. These auctions are like giant virtual flea markets. There are sellers and bidders -- and winners and losers. 
You get to decide what you want to become. We give sellers a storefront from which, everything from sports memorabilia to art to millions of international buyers.
